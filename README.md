# 1. What is the problem?
Air pollution is a serious problem, especially in larger cities. In the long term, smog can cause many health problems, such as respiratory disease or even cancer. Household air pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2 million deaths in 2020. The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. That’s why it’s good to know whether the air that we breathe is polluted or not, in order to prevent its effects. We came up with the idea of creating an air pollution sensor that will monitor the quality of air in users' surroundings.
# 2. The environment in which the device will work.
The device is supposed to work indoors in stable conditions. For the best results, it should be placed (from) where the air flows into the room e.g. a location close to the window or air conditioning.  While performing the readings, the device shouldn’t be touched or moved. It ought to be protected from any liquids. It can be set outdoors, but it has to meet certain requirements such as a dry environment and temperatures in the range of -10C to 60C.
# 3. Minimum functionality/ design assumptions.
Minimum functionality:
-The device should work, i.e. it has to measure air pollution, and the measurement should be displayed on the LCD screen.
design assumptions:
- low cost
- easy to set up
- low power consumption
- high efficiency
- user friendly

# 4. Solutions from the market (pros, cons, cost of the device and maintenance).
**Pros:**
- Usually, it is easy to set, the only thing users have to do is simply turn on the device
- User-friendly interfaces
- Build-in battery, so it does not need to be powered by a charger
- It uses little space
  
**Cons:**
- There are a lot of various devices, so it is hard to decide what device will suit the user
- It can be very expensive
- some air purity meters have additional functions, which are not necessarily needed by the user
- lots of kitschy-looking devices
  
**Cost of the device:**
- cost oscillate from 200zł to 1000zł
  
**Maintenance:**
- Producents typically provide 2 years of warranty
- These products generally are tiny, so it may be tough or even impossible to repair them by yourself
